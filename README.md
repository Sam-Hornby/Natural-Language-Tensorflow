# Natural-Language-Tensorflow

This repository is a collection of projects for natural language tasks done mainly in Tensorflow. 

The two files, Sentence-entailment.ipynb and LSTM-with-attention.py are both implementing a paper on sentence entailment 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06664) using 2 LSTM cells and an attention mechanism. I have not uploaded the glove vectors 
file or the SNLI data sets due to there size. These can be found at http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ (the link to glove.6B.zip) and 
http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/. Remember to choose the appropriate glove dimension for the glove file you choose. This is meant as a way of helping you implement the paper for yourself so I have not covered every last detail but instead done the main mechanism and left out the standard aspects of the paper such as the linear layer. If you want to repeat the results of the paper remember to add the smaller details into your code.

I hope to upload the next project soon.
