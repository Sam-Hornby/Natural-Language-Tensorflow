# Natural-Language-Tensorflow

This repository is a collection of projects for natural language tasks done mainly in Tensorflow. 

The two files, Sentence-entailment.ipynb and LSTM-with-attention.py are both implementing a paper on sentence entailment 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06664) using 2 LSTM cells and an attention mechanism. I have not uploaded the glove vectors 
file or the SNLI data sets due to there size. These can be found at http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ (the link to glove.6B.zip) and 
http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/. Remember to choose the appropriate glove dimension for the glove file you choose.

I hope to upload the next project soon.
